# FitTrack – AI-Powered Personal Fit 7

**Description**

FitTrack – AI-Powered Personal Fit 7 is a comprehensive web and mobile platform designed to deliver personalized workout and nutrition plans. Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, the platform adapts to individual user goals, preferences, and live health data to optimize fitness and nutrition guidance.

## Tech Stack

- PyTorch
- FastAPI
- ASP.NET Core

## Requirements

- Python environment with PyTorch installed
- FastAPI framework setup
- ASP.NET Core server environment
- Database setup for user data and real-time health tracking

## Installation

### Backend (FastAPI + PyTorch)

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FitTrack.git
cd FitTrack


2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate


3. Install dependencies:

bash
pip install torch fastapi uvicorn


4. Configure environment variables as needed for API keys, database connections, etc.

### Frontend / Mobile

- Set up the mobile app environment as per your framework requirements (not detailed here).

### ASP.NET Core Backend

1. Open the ASP.NET Core project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
2. Restore dependencies and build the project.
3. Configure appsettings.json for database and API connections.
4. Run the server.

## Usage

- Start the FastAPI backend:

bash
uvicorn main:app --reload


- Access the API endpoints through your frontend or mobile application.
- Use the mobile or web interface to input user data, and receive personalized workout and nutrition plans generated by the integrated AI models.

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up the development environment with the necessary tech stacks.
2. Develop AI models using PyTorch for workout and nutrition plan generation.
3. Create FastAPI endpoints for data intake and plan delivery.
4. Integrate the AI models with FastAPI API routes.
5. Develop the ASP.NET Core backend to handle user authentication, data storage, and serve as a bridge between front-end and backend AI services.
6. Build front-end and mobile app interfaces for user interaction.
7. Test the integrated system thoroughly.
8. Deploy the backend services and frontend/mobile applications.

(Optional) ## API Endpoints

*(Note: Specific API endpoints are to be developed based on application requirements but would typically include)*

- `POST /api/user` — to create or update user data
- `GET /api/plans/{user_id}` — to retrieve personalized plans
- `POST /api/health-data` — to send real-time health tracking data
